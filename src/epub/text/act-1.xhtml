			<h2><b>ACT I</b></h2>
<h4><b>SCENE I. A hall in the Duke’s palace.</b></h4>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Duke, Egeon, Jailer,
Officers</span> and other <span class="charname">Attendants</span>.</p>
<p>EGEON.<br/>
Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,<br/>
And by the doom of death end woes and all.
</p>
<p>DUKE.<br/>
Merchant of Syracusa, plead no more.<br/>
I am not partial to infringe our laws.<br/>
The enmity and discord which of late<br/>
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your Duke<br/>
To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,<br/>
Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,<br/>
Have seal’d his rigorous statutes with their bloods,<br/>
Excludes all pity from our threat’ning looks.<br/>
For since the mortal and intestine jars<br/>
’Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,<br/>
It hath in solemn synods been decreed,<br/>
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,<br/>
To admit no traffic to our adverse towns;<br/>
Nay more, if any born at Ephesus<br/>
Be seen at Syracusian marts and fairs;<br/>
Again, if any Syracusian born<br/>
Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,<br/>
His goods confiscate to the Duke’s dispose,<br/>
Unless a thousand marks be levied<br/>
To quit the penalty and to ransom him.<br/>
Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,<br/>
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;<br/>
Therefore by law thou art condemn’d to die.
</p>
<p>EGEON.<br/>
Yet this my comfort; when your words are done,<br/>
My woes end likewise with the evening sun.
</p>
<p>DUKE.<br/>
Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause<br/>
Why thou departedst from thy native home,<br/>
And for what cause thou cam’st to Ephesus.
</p>
<p>EGEON.<br/>
A heavier task could not have been impos’d<br/>
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable;<br/>
Yet, that the world may witness that my end<br/>
Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,<br/>
I’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.<br/>
In Syracusa was I born, and wed<br/>
Unto a woman happy but for me,<br/>
And by me, had not our hap been bad.<br/>
With her I liv’d in joy; our wealth increas’d<br/>
By prosperous voyages I often made<br/>
To Epidamnum, till my factor’s death,<br/>
And the great care of goods at random left,<br/>
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse;<br/>
From whom my absence was not six months old<br/>
Before herself (almost at fainting under<br/>
The pleasing punishment that women bear)<br/>
Had made provision for her following me,<br/>
And soon and safe arrived where I was.<br/>
There had she not been long but she became<br/>
A joyful mother of two goodly sons,<br/>
And, which was strange, the one so like the other<br/>
As could not be distinguish’d but by names.<br/>
That very hour, and in the self-same inn,<br/>
A mean woman was delivered<br/>
Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.<br/>
Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,<br/>
I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.<br/>
My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,<br/>
Made daily motions for our home return.<br/>
Unwilling I agreed; alas, too soon<br/>
We came aboard.<br/>
A league from Epidamnum had we sail’d<br/>
Before the always-wind-obeying deep<br/>
Gave any tragic instance of our harm;<br/>
But longer did we not retain much hope;<br/>
For what obscured light the heavens did grant<br/>
Did but convey unto our fearful minds<br/>
A doubtful warrant of immediate death,<br/>
Which though myself would gladly have embrac’d,<br/>
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,<br/>
Weeping before for what she saw must come,<br/>
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,<br/>
That mourn’d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,<br/>
Forc’d me to seek delays for them and me.<br/>
And this it was (for other means was none).<br/>
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,<br/>
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us.<br/>
My wife, more careful for the latter-born,<br/>
Had fast’ned him unto a small spare mast,<br/>
Such as sea-faring men provide for storms.<br/>
To him one of the other twins was bound,<br/>
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.<br/>
The children thus dispos’d, my wife and I,<br/>
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix’d,<br/>
Fast’ned ourselves at either end the mast,<br/>
And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,<br/>
Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.<br/>
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,<br/>
Dispers’d those vapours that offended us,<br/>
And by the benefit of his wished light<br/>
The seas wax’d calm, and we discovered<br/>
Two ships from far, making amain to us,<br/>
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.<br/>
But ere they came—O, let me say no more!<br/>
Gather the sequel by that went before.
</p>
<p>DUKE.<br/>
Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so,<br/>
For we may pity, though not pardon thee.
</p>
<p>EGEON.<br/>
O, had the gods done so, I had not now<br/>
Worthily term’d them merciless to us.<br/>
For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,<br/>
We were encountered by a mighty rock,<br/>
Which being violently borne upon,<br/>
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;<br/>
So that, in this unjust divorce of us,<br/>
Fortune had left to both of us alike<br/>
What to delight in, what to sorrow for.<br/>
Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdened<br/>
With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,<br/>
Was carried with more speed before the wind,<br/>
And in our sight they three were taken up<br/>
By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.<br/>
At length another ship had seiz’d on us;<br/>
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,<br/>
Gave healthful welcome to their ship-wrack’d guests,<br/>
And would have reft the fishers of their prey,<br/>
Had not their bark been very slow of sail;<br/>
And therefore homeward did they bend their course.<br/>
Thus have you heard me sever’d from my bliss,<br/>
That by misfortunes was my life prolong’d<br/>
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
</p>
<p>DUKE.<br/>
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,<br/>
Do me the favour to dilate at full<br/>
What have befall’n of them and thee till now.
</p>
<p>EGEON.<br/>
My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,<br/>
At eighteen years became inquisitive<br/>
After his brother, and importun’d me<br/>
That his attendant, so his case was like,<br/>
Reft of his brother, but retain’d his name,<br/>
Might bear him company in the quest of him;<br/>
Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see,<br/>
I hazarded the loss of whom I lov’d.<br/>
Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,<br/>
Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,<br/>
And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus,<br/>
Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought<br/>
Or that or any place that harbours men.<br/>
But here must end the story of my life;<br/>
And happy were I in my timely death,<br/>
Could all my travels warrant me they live.
</p>
<p>DUKE.<br/>
Hapless Egeon, whom the fates have mark’d<br/>
To bear the extremity of dire mishap;<br/>
Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,<br/>
Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,<br/>
Which princes, would they, may not disannul,<br/>
My soul should sue as advocate for thee.<br/>
But though thou art adjudged to the death,<br/>
And passed sentence may not be recall’d<br/>
But to our honour’s great disparagement,<br/>
Yet will I favour thee in what I can.<br/>
Therefore, merchant, I’ll limit thee this day<br/>
To seek thy health by beneficial help.<br/>
Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;<br/>
Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,<br/>
And live; if no, then thou art doom’d to die.<br/>
Jailer, take him to thy custody.
</p>
<p>JAILER.<br/>
I will, my lord.
</p>
<p>EGEON.<br/>
Hopeless and helpless doth Egeon wend,<br/>
But to procrastinate his lifeless end.

<h4><b>SCENE II. A public place.</b></h4>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Antipholus</span> and
<span class="charname">Dromio of Syracuse</span> and a
<span class="charname">Merchant</span>.</p>
<p>MERCHANT.<br/>
Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,<br/>
Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.<br/>
This very day a Syracusian merchant<br/>
Is apprehended for arrival here,<br/>
And, not being able to buy out his life,<br/>
According to the statute of the town<br/>
Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.<br/>
There is your money that I had to keep.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,<br/>
And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.<br/>
Within this hour it will be dinnertime;<br/>
Till that, I’ll view the manners of the town,<br/>
Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,<br/>
And then return and sleep within mine inn,<br/>
For with long travel I am stiff and weary.<br/>
Get thee away.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Many a man would take you at your word,<br/>
And go indeed, having so good a mean.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exit <span class="charname">Dromio</span>.</i>]</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,<br/>
When I am dull with care and melancholy,<br/>
Lightens my humour with his merry jests.<br/>
What, will you walk with me about the town,<br/>
And then go to my inn and dine with me?
</p>
<p>MERCHANT.<br/>
I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,<br/>
Of whom I hope to make much benefit.<br/>
I crave your pardon. Soon, at five o’clock,<br/>
Please you, I’ll meet with you upon the mart,<br/>
And afterward consort you till bedtime.<br/>
My present business calls me from you now.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Farewell till then: I will go lose myself,<br/>
And wander up and down to view the city.
</p>
<p>MERCHANT.<br/>
Sir, I commend you to your own content.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exit <span class="charname">Merchant</span>.</i>]</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
He that commends me to mine own content<br/>
Commends me to the thing I cannot get.<br/>
I to the world am like a drop of water<br/>
That in the ocean seeks another drop,<br/>
Who, failing there to find his fellow forth,<br/>
Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself.<br/>
So I, to find a mother and a brother,<br/>
In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Dromio of Ephesus</span>.</p>
<p>Here comes the almanac of my true date.<br/>
What now? How chance thou art return’d so soon?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Return’d so soon? rather approach’d too late.<br/>
The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit;<br/>
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;<br/>
My mistress made it one upon my cheek.<br/>
She is so hot because the meat is cold;<br/>
The meat is cold because you come not home;<br/>
You come not home because you have no stomach;<br/>
You have no stomach, having broke your fast;<br/>
But we that know what ’tis to fast and pray,<br/>
Are penitent for your default today.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Stop in your wind, sir, tell me this, I pray:<br/>
Where have you left the money that I gave you?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
O, sixpence that I had o’ Wednesday last<br/>
To pay the saddler for my mistress’ crupper:<br/>
The saddler had it, sir, I kept it not.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
I am not in a sportive humour now.<br/>
Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?<br/>
We being strangers here, how dar’st thou trust<br/>
So great a charge from thine own custody?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
I pray you jest, sir, as you sit at dinner:<br/>
I from my mistress come to you in post;<br/>
If I return, I shall be post indeed,<br/>
For she will score your fault upon my pate.<br/>
Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,<br/>
And strike you home without a messenger.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season,<br/>
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.<br/>
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me!
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,<br/>
And tell me how thou hast dispos’d thy charge.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart<br/>
Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner.<br/>
My mistress and her sister stay for you.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Now, as I am a Christian, answer me<br/>
In what safe place you have bestow’d my money,<br/>
Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours<br/>
That stands on tricks when I am undispos’d;<br/>
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
I have some marks of yours upon my pate,<br/>
Some of my mistress’ marks upon my shoulders,<br/>
But not a thousand marks between you both.<br/>
If I should pay your worship those again,<br/>
Perchance you will not bear them patiently.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Thy mistress’ marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Your worship’s wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;<br/>
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,<br/>
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,<br/>
Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
What mean you, sir? for God’s sake hold your hands.<br/>
Nay, an you will not, sir, I’ll take my heels.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exit <span class="charname">Dromio</span>.</i>]</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Upon my life, by some device or other<br/>
The villain is o’er-raught of all my money.<br/>
They say this town is full of cozenage,<br/>
As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,<br/>
Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,<br/>
Soul-killing witches that deform the body,<br/>
Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,<br/>
And many such-like liberties of sin:<br/>
If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.<br/>
I’ll to the Centaur to go seek this slave.<br/>
I greatly fear my money is not safe.
