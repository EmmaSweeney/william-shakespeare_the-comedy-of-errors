			<h2><b>ACT II</b></h2>
<h4><b>SCENE I. A public place.</b></h4>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Adriana</span>, wife to
Antipholus (of Ephesus) with <span class="charname">Luciana</span> her
sister.</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
Neither my husband nor the slave return’d<br/>
That in such haste I sent to seek his master?<br/>
Sure, Luciana, it is two o’clock.
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,<br/>
And from the mart he’s somewhere gone to dinner.<br/>
Good sister, let us dine, and never fret;<br/>
A man is master of his liberty;<br/>
Time is their master, and when they see time,<br/>
They’ll go or come. If so, be patient, sister.
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
Why should their liberty than ours be more?
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
Because their business still lies out o’ door.
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
O, know he is the bridle of your will.
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
There’s none but asses will be bridled so.
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
Why, headstrong liberty is lash’d with woe.<br/>
There’s nothing situate under heaven’s eye<br/>
But hath his bound in earth, in sea, in sky.<br/>
The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls<br/>
Are their males’ subjects, and at their controls.<br/>
Man, more divine, the masters of all these,<br/>
Lord of the wide world and wild wat’ry seas,<br/>
Indued with intellectual sense and souls,<br/>
Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,<br/>
Are masters to their females, and their lords:<br/>
Then let your will attend on their accords.
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
Ere I learn love, I’ll practise to obey.
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
How if your husband start some other where?
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
Till he come home again, I would forbear.
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
Patience unmov’d! No marvel though she pause;<br/>
They can be meek that have no other cause.<br/>
A wretched soul bruis’d with adversity,<br/>
We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;<br/>
But were we burd’ned with like weight of pain,<br/>
As much, or more, we should ourselves complain:<br/>
So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,<br/>
With urging helpless patience would relieve me:<br/>
But if thou live to see like right bereft,<br/>
This fool-begg’d patience in thee will be left.
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
Well, I will marry one day, but to try.<br/>
Here comes your man, now is your husband nigh.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Dromio of Ephesus</span>.</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Nay, he’s at two hands with me, and that my two ears can witness.
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
Say, didst thou speak with him? know’st thou his mind?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear.<br/>
Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
Spake he so doubtfully thou couldst not feel his meaning?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Nay, he struck so plainly I could too well feel his blows; and withal so
doubtfully that I could scarce understand them.
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
But say, I prithee, is he coming home?<br/>
It seems he hath great care to please his wife.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
Horn-mad, thou villain?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
I mean not cuckold-mad,<br/>
But sure he’s stark mad.<br/>
When I desir’d him to come home to dinner,<br/>
He ask’d me for a thousand marks in gold.<br/>
“’Tis dinner time,” quoth I. “My gold,” quoth he.<br/>
“Your meat doth burn” quoth I. “My gold,” quoth he.<br/>
“Will you come home?” quoth I. “My gold,” quoth he.<br/>
“Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?”<br/>
“The pig” quoth I “is burn’d”. “My gold,” quoth he.<br/>
“My mistress, sir,” quoth I. “Hang up thy mistress;<br/>
I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!”
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
Quoth who?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Quoth my master.<br/>
“I know,” quoth he, “no house, no wife, no mistress.”<br/>
So that my errand, due unto my tongue,<br/>
I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;<br/>
For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Go back again, and be new beaten home?<br/>
For God’s sake, send some other messenger.
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
Back slave, or I will break thy pate across.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
And he will bless that cross with other beating.<br/>
Between you I shall have a holy head.
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
Hence, prating peasant. Fetch thy master home.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Am I so round with you, as you with me,<br/>
That like a football you do spurn me thus?<br/>
You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither.<br/>
If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
Fie, how impatience loureth in your face.
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
His company must do his minions grace,<br/>
Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.<br/>
Hath homely age th’ alluring beauty took<br/>
From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it.<br/>
Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?<br/>
If voluble and sharp discourse be marr’d,<br/>
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard.<br/>
Do their gay vestments his affections bait?<br/>
That’s not my fault; he’s master of my state.<br/>
What ruins are in me that can be found<br/>
By him not ruin’d? Then is he the ground<br/>
Of my defeatures. My decayed fair<br/>
A sunny look of his would soon repair;<br/>
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale<br/>
And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence.
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.<br/>
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,<br/>
Or else what lets it but he would be here?<br/>
Sister, you know he promis’d me a chain;<br/>
Would that alone, a love he would detain,<br/>
So he would keep fair quarter with his bed.<br/>
I see the jewel best enamelled<br/>
Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still<br/>
That others touch, yet often touching will<br/>
Wear gold; and no man that hath a name<br/>
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.<br/>
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,<br/>
I’ll weep what’s left away, and weeping die.
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exeunt.</i>]</p>
<h4><b>SCENE II. The same.</b></h4>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Antipholus of Syracuse</span>.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up<br/>
Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave<br/>
Is wander’d forth in care to seek me out.<br/>
By computation and mine host’s report.<br/>
I could not speak with Dromio since at first<br/>
I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Dromio of Syracuse</span>.</p>
<p>How now, sir! is your merry humour alter’d?<br/>
As you love strokes, so jest with me again.<br/>
You know no Centaur? you receiv’d no gold?<br/>
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?<br/>
My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,<br/>
That thus so madly thou didst answer me?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Even now, even here, not half an hour since.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
I did not see you since you sent me hence,<br/>
Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Villain, thou didst deny the gold’s receipt,<br/>
And told’st me of a mistress and a dinner,<br/>
For which I hope thou felt’st I was displeas’d.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
I am glad to see you in this merry vein.<br/>
What means this jest, I pray you, master, tell me?
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?<br/>
Think’st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.<br/>
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Beats Dromio.</i>]</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Hold, sir, for God’s sake, now your jest is earnest.<br/>
Upon what bargain do you give it me?
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Because that I familiarly sometimes<br/>
Do use you for my fool, and chat with you,<br/>
Your sauciness will jest upon my love,<br/>
And make a common of my serious hours.<br/>
When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,<br/>
But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.<br/>
If you will jest with me, know my aspect,<br/>
And fashion your demeanour to my looks,<br/>
Or I will beat this method in your sconce.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Sconce, call you it? so you would leave battering, I had rather have it a head.
And you use these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head, and ensconce it
too, or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders. But I pray, sir, why am I
beaten?
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Dost thou not know?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Shall I tell you why?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say, every why hath a wherefore.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Why, first, for flouting me; and then wherefore,<br/>
For urging it the second time to me.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,<br/>
When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason?<br/>
Well, sir, I thank you.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Thank me, sir, for what?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
I’ll make you amends next, to give you nothing for something.<br/>
But say, sir, is it dinner-time?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
In good time, sir, what’s that?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Basting.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Well, sir, then ’twill be dry.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of it.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Your reason?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Lest it make you choleric, and purchase me another dry basting.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Well, sir, learn to jest in good time.<br/>
There’s a time for all things.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
I durst have denied that before you were so choleric.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
By what rule, sir?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Let’s hear it.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
There’s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
May he not do it by fine and recovery?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and recover the lost hair of another man.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is, so plentiful
an excrement?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts, and what he
hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Why, but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
The plainer dealer, the sooner lost. Yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
For what reason?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
For two, and sound ones too.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Nay, not sound, I pray you.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Sure ones, then.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Certain ones, then.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Name them.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner
they should not drop in his porridge.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Marry, and did, sir; namely, e’en no time to recover hair lost by nature.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
But your reason was not substantial why there is no time to recover.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald, and therefore, to the world’s end
will have bald followers.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
I knew ’twould be a bald conclusion.<br/>
But soft! who wafts us yonder?
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Adriana</span> and
<span class="charname">Luciana</span>.</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown,<br/>
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects.<br/>
I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.<br/>
The time was once when thou unurg’d wouldst vow<br/>
That never words were music to thine ear,<br/>
That never object pleasing in thine eye,<br/>
That never touch well welcome to thy hand,<br/>
That never meat sweet-savour’d in thy taste,<br/>
Unless I spake, or look’d, or touch’d, or carv’d to thee.<br/>
How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,<br/>
That thou art then estranged from thyself?<br/>
Thyself I call it, being strange to me,<br/>
That, undividable, incorporate,<br/>
Am better than thy dear self’s better part.<br/>
Ah, do not tear away thyself from me;<br/>
For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall<br/>
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,<br/>
And take unmingled thence that drop again<br/>
Without addition or diminishing,<br/>
As take from me thyself, and not me too.<br/>
How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,<br/>
Should’st thou but hear I were licentious?<br/>
And that this body, consecrate to thee,<br/>
By ruffian lust should be contaminate?<br/>
Wouldst thou not spit at me, and spurn at me,<br/>
And hurl the name of husband in my face,<br/>
And tear the stain’d skin off my harlot brow,<br/>
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring,<br/>
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?<br/>
I know thou canst; and therefore, see thou do it.<br/>
I am possess’d with an adulterate blot;<br/>
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust;<br/>
For if we two be one, and thou play false,<br/>
I do digest the poison of thy flesh,<br/>
Being strumpeted by thy contagion.<br/>
Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed,<br/>
I live distain’d, thou undishonoured.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not.<br/>
In Ephesus I am but two hours old,<br/>
As strange unto your town as to your talk,<br/>
Who, every word by all my wit being scann’d,<br/>
Wants wit in all one word to understand.
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
Fie, brother, how the world is chang’d with you.<br/>
When were you wont to use my sister thus?<br/>
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
By Dromio?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
By me?
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
By thee; and this thou didst return from him,<br/>
That he did buffet thee, and in his blows<br/>
Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?<br/>
What is the course and drift of your compact?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
I, sir? I never saw her till this time.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Villain, thou liest, for even her very words<br/>
Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
I never spake with her in all my life.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
How can she thus, then, call us by our names?<br/>
Unless it be by inspiration.
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
How ill agrees it with your gravity<br/>
To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,<br/>
Abetting him to thwart me in my mood;<br/>
Be it my wrong, you are from me exempt,<br/>
But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.<br/>
Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine.<br/>
Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,<br/>
Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,<br/>
Makes me with thy strength to communicate:<br/>
If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,<br/>
Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss,<br/>
Who all, for want of pruning, with intrusion<br/>
Infect thy sap, and live on thy confusion.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme.<br/>
What, was I married to her in my dream?<br/>
Or sleep I now, and think I hear all this?<br/>
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?<br/>
Until I know this sure uncertainty<br/>
I’ll entertain the offer’d fallacy.
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.<br/>
This is the fairy land; O spite of spites!<br/>
We talk with goblins, owls, and sprites;<br/>
If we obey them not, this will ensue:<br/>
They’ll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
Why prat’st thou to thyself, and answer’st not?<br/>
Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
I am transformed, master, am I not?
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Thou hast thine own form.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
No, I am an ape.
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
If thou art chang’d to aught, ’tis to an ass.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
’Tis true; she rides me, and I long for grass.<br/>
’Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be<br/>
But I should know her as well as she knows me.
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,<br/>
To put the finger in the eye and weep<br/>
Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn.<br/>
Come, sir, to dinner; Dromio, keep the gate.<br/>
Husband, I’ll dine above with you today,<br/>
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.<br/>
Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,<br/>
Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.<br/>
Come, sister; Dromio, play the porter well.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?<br/>
Sleeping or waking, mad, or well-advis’d?<br/>
Known unto these, and to myself disguis’d!<br/>
I’ll say as they say, and persever so,<br/>
And in this mist at all adventures go.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Master, shall I be porter at the gate?
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.
