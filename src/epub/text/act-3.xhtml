			<h2><b>ACT III</b></h2>
<h4><b>SCENE I. The same.</b></h4>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Antipholus of
Ephesus</span>, his man <span class="charname">Dromio of Ephesus, Angelo</span>
the goldsmith and <span class="charname">Balthasar</span> the merchant.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all,<br/>
My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours.<br/>
Say that I linger’d with you at your shop<br/>
To see the making of her carcanet,<br/>
And that tomorrow you will bring it home.<br/>
But here’s a villain that would face me down.<br/>
He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,<br/>
And charg’d him with a thousand marks in gold,<br/>
And that I did deny my wife and house.<br/>
Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know.<br/>
That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show;<br/>
If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,<br/>
Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br/>
I think thou art an ass.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Marry, so it doth appear<br/>
By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.<br/>
I should kick, being kick’d; and being at that pass,<br/>
You would keep from my heels, and beware of an ass.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br/>
You’re sad, Signior Balthasar; pray God our cheer<br/>
May answer my good will and your good welcome here.
</p>
<p>BALTHASAR.<br/>
I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br/>
O, Signior Balthasar, either at flesh or fish<br/>
A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.
</p>
<p>BALTHASAR.<br/>
Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br/>
And welcome more common, for that’s nothing but words.
</p>
<p>BALTHASAR<br/>
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest.<br/>
But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;<br/>
Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.<br/>
But soft; my door is lock’d. Go bid them let us in.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicely, Gillian, Ginn!
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
[<i>Within.</i>] Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb, idiot, patch!<br/>
Either get thee from the door or sit down at the hatch:<br/>
Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call’st for such store<br/>
When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
What patch is made our porter? My master stays in the street.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Let him walk from whence he came, lest he catch cold on’s feet.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Who talks within there? Ho, open the door.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Right, sir, I’ll tell you when an you’ll tell me wherefore.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Wherefore? For my dinner. I have not dined today.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Nor today here you must not; come again when you may.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br/>
What art thou that keep’st me out from the house I owe?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
The porter for this time, sir, and my name is Dromio.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
O villain, thou hast stolen both mine office and my name;<br/>
The one ne’er got me credit, the other mickle blame.<br/>
If thou hadst been Dromio today in my place,<br/>
Thou wouldst have chang’d thy face for a name, or thy name for an ass.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Luce</span> concealed from
Antipholus of Ephesus and his companions.
</p>
<p>LUCE.<br/>
[<i>Within.</i>] What a coil is there, Dromio, who are those at the gate?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Let my master in, Luce.
</p>
<p>LUCE.<br/>
Faith, no, he comes too late,<br/>
And so tell your master.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
O Lord, I must laugh;<br/>
Have at you with a proverb:—Shall I set in my staff?
</p>
<p>LUCE.<br/>
Have at you with another: that’s—When? can you tell?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
If thy name be called Luce,—Luce, thou hast answer’d him well.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Do you hear, you minion? you’ll let us in, I hope?
</p>
<p>LUCE.<br/>
I thought to have ask’d you.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
And you said no.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
So, come, help. Well struck, there was blow for blow.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Thou baggage, let me in.
</p>
<p>LUCE.<br/>
Can you tell for whose sake?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Master, knock the door hard.
</p>
<p>LUCE.<br/>
Let him knock till it ache.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br/>
You’ll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.
</p>
<p>LUCE.<br/>
What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Adriana</span> concealed from
Antipholus of Ephesus and his companions.
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
[<i>Within.</i>] Who is that at the door that keeps all this noise?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
By my troth, your town is troubled with unruly boys.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Are you there, wife? you might have come before.
</p>
<p>ADRIANA.<br/>
Your wife, sir knave? go, get you from the door.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
If you went in pain, master, this knave would go sore.
</p>
<p>ANGELO.<br/>
Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome. We would fain have either.
</p>
<p>BALTHASAR.<br/>
In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br/>
There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.<br/>
Your cake here is warm within; you stand here in the cold.<br/>
It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Go, fetch me something, I’ll break ope the gate.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Break any breaking here, and I’ll break your knave’s pate.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind;<br/>
Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
It seems thou want’st breaking; out upon thee, hind!
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Here’s too much “out upon thee”; I pray thee, let me in.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Well, I’ll break in; go, borrow me a crow.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF EPHESUS.<br/>
A crow without feather; master, mean you so?<br/>
For a fish without a fin, there’s a fowl without a feather.<br/>
If a crow help us in, sirrah, we’ll pluck a crow together.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Go, get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
</p>
<p>BALTHASAR.<br/>
Have patience, sir. O, let it not be so:<br/>
Herein you war against your reputation,<br/>
And draw within the compass of suspect<br/>
The unviolated honour of your wife.<br/>
Once this,—your long experience of her wisdom,<br/>
Her sober virtue, years, and modesty,<br/>
Plead on her part some cause to you unknown;<br/>
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse<br/>
Why at this time the doors are made against you.<br/>
Be rul’d by me; depart in patience,<br/>
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,<br/>
And about evening, come yourself alone<br/>
To know the reason of this strange restraint.<br/>
If by strong hand you offer to break in<br/>
Now in the stirring passage of the day,<br/>
A vulgar comment will be made of it;<br/>
And that supposed by the common rout<br/>
Against your yet ungalled estimation<br/>
That may with foul intrusion enter in,<br/>
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;<br/>
For slander lives upon succession,<br/>
For ever hous’d where it gets possession.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br/>
You have prevail’d. I will depart in quiet,<br/>
And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.<br/>
I know a wench of excellent discourse,<br/>
Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle;<br/>
There will we dine. This woman that I mean,<br/>
My wife (but, I protest, without desert)<br/>
Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal;<br/>
To her will we to dinner.—Get you home<br/>
And fetch the chain, by this I know ’tis made.<br/>
Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine,<br/>
For there’s the house. That chain will I bestow<br/>
(Be it for nothing but to spite my wife)<br/>
Upon mine hostess there. Good sir, make haste.<br/>
Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,<br/>
I’ll knock elsewhere, to see if they’ll disdain me.
</p>
<p>ANGELO.<br/>
I’ll meet you at that place some hour hence.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.<br/>
Do so; this jest shall cost me some expense.
</p>

<h4><b>SCENE II. The same.</b></h4>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Luciana</span> with
<span class="charname">Antipholus of Syracuse</span>.</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
And may it be that you have quite forgot<br/>
A husband’s office? Shall, Antipholus,<br/>
Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?<br/>
Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?<br/>
If you did wed my sister for her wealth,<br/>
Then for her wealth’s sake use her with more kindness;<br/>
Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth,<br/>
Muffle your false love with some show of blindness.<br/>
Let not my sister read it in your eye;<br/>
Be not thy tongue thy own shame’s orator;<br/>
Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;<br/>
Apparel vice like virtue’s harbinger;<br/>
Bear a fair presence though your heart be tainted;<br/>
Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint,<br/>
Be secret-false. What need she be acquainted?<br/>
What simple thief brags of his own attaint?<br/>
’Tis double wrong to truant with your bed<br/>
And let her read it in thy looks at board.<br/>
Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;<br/>
Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word.<br/>
Alas, poor women, make us but believe,<br/>
Being compact of credit, that you love us.<br/>
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;<br/>
We in your motion turn, and you may move us.<br/>
Then, gentle brother, get you in again;<br/>
Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife.<br/>
’Tis holy sport to be a little vain<br/>
When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Sweet mistress, what your name is else, I know not,<br/>
Nor by what wonder you do hit on mine;<br/>
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not<br/>
Than our earth’s wonder, more than earth divine.<br/>
Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;<br/>
Lay open to my earthy gross conceit,<br/>
Smother’d in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,<br/>
The folded meaning of your words’ deceit.<br/>
Against my soul’s pure truth why labour you<br/>
To make it wander in an unknown field?<br/>
Are you a god? would you create me new?<br/>
Transform me, then, and to your power I’ll yield.<br/>
But if that I am I, then well I know<br/>
Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,<br/>
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe.<br/>
Far more, far more, to you do I decline.<br/>
O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note<br/>
To drown me in thy sister’s flood of tears.<br/>
Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote;<br/>
Spread o’er the silver waves thy golden hairs,<br/>
And as a bed I’ll take thee, and there lie,<br/>
And, in that glorious supposition think<br/>
He gains by death that hath such means to die.<br/>
Let love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
What, are you mad, that you do reason so?
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
It is a fault that springeth from your eye.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
Why call you me love? Call my sister so.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Thy sister’s sister.
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
That’s my sister.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
No,<br/>
It is thyself, mine own self’s better part,<br/>
Mine eye’s clear eye, my dear heart’s dearer heart,<br/>
My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope’s aim,<br/>
My sole earth’s heaven, and my heaven’s claim.
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
All this my sister is, or else should be.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Call thyself sister, sweet, for I aim thee;<br/>
Thee will I love, and with thee lead my life;<br/>
Thou hast no husband yet, nor I no wife.<br/>
Give me thy hand.
</p>
<p>LUCIANA.<br/>
O, soft, sir, hold you still;<br/>
I’ll fetch my sister to get her goodwill.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exit <span class="charname">Luciana</span>.</i>]</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Dromio of Syracuse</span>.</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Why, how now, Dromio? where runn’st thou so fast?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Do you know me, sir? Am I Dromio? Am I your man? Am I myself?
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
I am an ass, I am a woman’s man, and besides myself.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
What woman’s man? and how besides thyself?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman, one that claims me, one that
haunts me, one that will have me.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
What claim lays she to thee?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Marry, sir, such claim as you would lay to your horse, and she would have me as
a beast; not that I being a beast she would have me, but that she being a very
beastly creature lays claim to me.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
What is she?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may not speak of
without he say “sir-reverence”. I have but lean luck in the match,
and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
How dost thou mean a “fat marriage”?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Marry, sir, she’s the kitchen wench, and all grease, and I know
not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run
from her by her own light. I warrant her rags and the tallow in
them will burn a Poland winter. If she lives till doomsday,
she’ll burn a week longer than the whole world.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
What complexion is she of?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Swart like my shoe, but her face nothing like so clean kept. For
why? she sweats, a man may go overshoes in the grime of it.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
That’s a fault that water will mend.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
No, sir, ’tis in grain; Noah’s flood could not do it.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
What’s her name?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that’s an ell and
three quarters, will not measure her from hip to hip.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Then she bears some breadth?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip. She is
spherical, like a globe. I could find out countries in her.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
In what part of her body stands Ireland?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Marry, sir, in her buttocks; I found it out by the bogs.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Where Scotland?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
I found it by the barrenness, hard in the palm of the hand.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Where France?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war against her hair.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Where England?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no whiteness in
them. But I guess it stood in her chin, by the salt rheum that
ran between France and it.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Where Spain?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Where America, the Indies?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
O, sir, upon her nose, all o’er-embellished with rubies,
carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the hot
breath of Spain, who sent whole armadoes of carracks to be
ballast at her nose.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
O, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude: this drudge or
diviner laid claim to me, called me Dromio, swore I was assured
to her, told me what privy marks I had about me, as the mark of
my shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm,
that I, amazed, ran from her as a witch. And, I think, if my
breast had not been made of faith, and my heart of steel, she had
transformed me to a curtal dog, and made me turn i’ the wheel.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Go, hie thee presently, post to the road;<br/>
And if the wind blow any way from shore,<br/>
I will not harbour in this town tonight.<br/>
If any bark put forth, come to the mart,<br/>
Where I will walk till thou return to me.<br/>
If everyone knows us, and we know none,<br/>
’Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.
</p>
<p>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
As from a bear a man would run for life,<br/>
So fly I from her that would be my wife.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
There’s none but witches do inhabit here,<br/>
And therefore ’tis high time that I were hence.<br/>
She that doth call me husband, even my soul<br/>
Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,<br/>
Possess’d with such a gentle sovereign grace,<br/>
Of such enchanting presence and discourse,<br/>
Hath almost made me traitor to myself.<br/>
But lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,<br/>
I’ll stop mine ears against the mermaid’s song.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Angelo</span> with the chain.</p>
<p>ANGELO.<br/>
Master Antipholus.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Ay, that’s my name.
</p>
<p>ANGELO.<br/>
I know it well, sir. Lo, here is the chain;<br/>
I thought to have ta’en you at the Porpentine,<br/>
The chain unfinish’d made me stay thus long.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
What is your will that I shall do with this?
</p>
<p>ANGELO.<br/>
What please yourself, sir; I have made it for you.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
</p>
<p>ANGELO.<br/>
Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.<br/>
Go home with it, and please your wife withal,<br/>
And soon at supper-time I’ll visit you,<br/>
And then receive my money for the chain.
</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
I pray you, sir, receive the money now,<br/>
For fear you ne’er see chain nor money more.
</p>
<p>ANGELO.<br/>
You are a merry man, sir; fare you well.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>
<p>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.<br/>
What I should think of this I cannot tell,<br/>
But this I think, there’s no man is so vain<br/>
That would refuse so fair an offer’d chain.<br/>
I see a man here needs not live by shifts,<br/>
When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.<br/>
I’ll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay;<br/>
If any ship put out, then straight away.
